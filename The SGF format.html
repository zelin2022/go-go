</p><h1><a name="SGF">The SGF format</a></h1>

<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
SGF is a format ('Smart Game Format') used to write down commented
game records, including variation trees, especially for the game Go.
It was introduced by Anders Kierulf in 1990, and his version is now called
<a href="http://www.red-bean.com/sgf/ff1_3/ff1.html">FF[1]</a>.
Martin MÃ¼ller (1995) made
<a href="http://www.red-bean.com/sgf/ff1_3/ff3.html">FF[3]</a>.
Arno Hollosi (1999) made
<a href="http://www.red-bean.com/sgf/">FF[4]</a>, which is
the current version.
<p>
The present text updates this standard to current usage.
In many places it comes with recommendations where FF[4] had prescriptions.
No version number is assigned other than the publication date.

</p><h2><a name="grammar">Grammar</a></h2>
An SGF file is a production of the following grammar,
possibly with interspersed ignored parts such as whitespace
(see Parsing, below).
<p>
</p><pre>  Collection     = { GameTree }
  GameTree       = "(" RootNode NodeSequence { Tail } ")"
  Tail           = "(" NodeSequence { Tail } ")"
  NodeSequence   = { Node }
  RootNode       = Node
  Node           = ";" { Property }
  Property       = PropIdent PropValue { PropValue }
  PropIdent      = UcLetter { UcLetter }
  PropValue      = "[" Value "]"
  UcLetter       = "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "G" | "H" | "I" |
                   "J" | "K" | "L" | "M" | "N" | "O" | "P" | "Q" | "R" |
                   "S" | "T" | "U" | "V" | "W" | "X" | "Y" | "Z"
</pre>
<p>
Here braces { } denote repetition (zero or more times), the vertical bar |
denotes a choice, and the strings "(", ")", ";", "[", "]", "A", ..., "Z"
are constants.
</p><p>
That is, an SGF file (<i>Collection</i>) is the concatenation of
zero or more <i>GameTree</i>s.
<br>
A <i>GameTree</i> is an open parenthesis, followed by a <i>NodeSequence</i>,
followed by zero or more <i>GameTree</i>s, followed by a close parenthesis.
<br>
A <i>NodeSequence</i> is the concatenation of zero or more <i>Node</i>s.
<br>
A <i>Node</i> is a semicolon followed by a <i>Property</i>.
<br>
A <i>Property</i> is an identifier (<i>PropIdent</i>) followed by one or more
<i>PropValue</i>s.
<br>
A <i>PropIdent</i> is a sequence of one or more
upper case letters (<i>UcLetter</i>s).
<br>
A <i>PropValue</i> consists
of arbitrary data enclosed in square brackets.
</p><p>

</p><h2><a name="parsing">Parsing</a></h2>
Whitespace is ignored everywhere, except inside a <i>Value</i>.
Inside a <i>Value</i> whitespace is significant, but an escaped newline
is ignored. Whitespace inside a <i>PropIdent</i> should be avoided.
<br>
Lower case letters are ignored inside a <i>PropIdent</i>.
<p>
There is no ambiguity in the grammar, as long as it is possible
to recognize the "]" that ends a <i>PropValue</i>. If a <i>Value</i>
contains a "]", it must be escaped. A symbol is escaped by preceding it
by a non-escaped "\".

</p><h2><a name="charset">Character set</a></h2>
An SGF file is a text file with text in a character set that includes
ASCII as a subset.
The constant strings with grammatical function are in ASCII.
By default, each <i>Value</i> is given in UTF-8. Then
the possibility that a character code might contain an embedded ']' byte
does not arise. If a different character set is used, then before the
first use of non-ASCII data there should be a property indicating the
character set, using the <i>PropIdent</i> "CA".
No escape is used for multibyte characters where one of the constituent
bytes has the value ']'.
<p>

</p><h2><a name="semantics">Semantics</a></h2>
A <i>Collection</i> represents a collection of game records.
<p>
A <i>GameTree</i> represents a single game record.
The <i>RootNode</i> gives metadata about the game.
Each further <i>Node</i> represents a move in the game.
A sequence of <i>Tail</i>s represents a number of
variations, possible sequels, to the game given thus far.
In particular, a <i>Tail</i> that is just "()" represents
the possibility of ending the game here.
</p><p>
In a record, the status of variations can differ.
If it represents an actually played game, together with variations,
then the moves actually played form a distinguished tail.
It will be the first tail given.
If the record represents a problem, there may be several correct
and incorrect solutions, and the first tail has no special status.

</p><h2><a name="games">Game types</a></h2>
The meaning of the property identifiers depends on the
type of game being played. This type is indicated using the
<i>PropIdent</i> "GM" in the root node.
In the text below we describe the use for the game of Go (Baduk, Weiqi).
The property "GM[1]" denotes a game record for this game.
If no such property is given, we shall assume that the record is
a Go record. For the meaning of values other than 1, see
<a href="#GM">GM</a>.
<p>
Below we give a very short description of the various properties,
ordered according to type. Afterwards a more precise grammar,
with properties ordered alphabetically.

</p><h2><a name="rootprops">Root node properties</a></h2>
The ordering of the properties in the root node is not significant.

<h3>Players</h3>
PB and PW give the Black and White players, and BR and WR their rank.
BC and WC are used for their countries. BT and WT for their teams.
<p>

</p><h3><a name="event">Event</a></h3>
EV and RO give event and round. DT and PC the date and place.
<p>

</p><h3><a name="game">Game details</a></h3>
TM gives the time available to each player.
OT ("Overtime") gives the type of byo-yomi,
and the number and length of periods.
One also uses LC and LT for the number and the length of the periods.
<p>
KM gives the komi paid by Black to White.
</p><p>
HA gives the handicap.
</p><p>
SZ gives the board size.
</p><p>
AB and AW ("Add Black", "Add White") give the black and white setup stones.
For search patterns one uses AB, AW, AE ("Add Empty") to denote positions that
must be Black, White and Empty.
</p><p>
PL ("Player") tells which player moves first.
</p><p>
RU gives the rule set used.
</p><p>
RE gives the result.
</p><p>
TB and TW give the final black and white territory.
</p><p>
MN gives the number of moves of the game.
<!-- One also finds OM -->
</p><p>
GC gives arbitrary comments.
</p><p>

</p><h3><a name="meta">Meta properties</a></h3>
CA gives the character set of the SGF file.
<p>
FF ("File Format") gives the number (1-4) of the SGF standard used.
</p><p>
AP gives the application program that produced this SGF file.
</p><p>
SO gives the source of information.
</p><p>
US gives the user who typed it in.
</p><p>
AN ("Annotator") gives the author of the comments.
</p><p>
CP gives copyright information.
</p><p>
GN ("Game Name") gives a name to the SGF file, such as its filename.

</p><h2><a name="nodeprops">Node properties</a></h2>
<h3><a name="moveprops">Move properties</a></h3>
B and W give moves by Black and White.
<p>
C gives a comment.
</p><p>
Various time properties indicate time used so far, time used for this move,
time still available for the rest of the game.
In particular, BL and WL are used for the time left for Black
(after a black move) or White (after a white move).
In Canadian byo-yomi, OB and OW are used for the number of
Black (White) moves that still have to be played in this period.
In Japanese byo-yomi, OB and OW are used for the number of
byo-yomi periods remaining.

</p><h3><a name="markupprops">Markup properties</a></h3>
In order to be able to refer to specific moves or positions,
one uses markup. How markup is realized upon game display
depends on the capabilities and properties of the displaying program.
The SGF standard is about describing possibly commented games,
not about displaying them, so the descriptions below can only be hints.
<p>
SL selects a number of unnamed points.
</p><p>
CR, SQ, TR, MA mark the indicated points with a circle, square, triangle, 'X'.
</p><p>
LB labels the indicated point with the given label.
</p><p>
N names its node.
</p><p>
MN (outside the root node) assigns a number to its node, probably
for display purposes.
<!-- For a game continuation, the intermediate position can be set up
using AB, AW, and the move number can be set using MN on the first move. -->

</p><h3><a name="displayprops">Display properties</a></h3>
Commented games are printed in a journal, or output on a screen.
Various properties can be added to the SGF file to direct this
printing or display. Various viewers or sgf-to-image converters
recognize properties such as VW ("View"), the part of the board
that should be displayed, and possibly further indications
about whether captured stones have to be shown, whether move numbers
are shown, and if so, what numbers, whether there are coordinates
around the board, and which type, whether hoshi should be shown,
whether stones are shown in 3D style, etc. etc.

<h2><a name="extendedprops">Extended properties</a></h2>
The properties mentioned above were of the type meant to be automatically
retrievable from a data base. Event, names, dates, results are likely
search fields. For free form information one uses extended properties.
The event can be "EV[60th Honinbo Title]", with extended information
"EVX[Sponsored by ..]". The date can be "DT[1980]", with extended
information "DTX[Broadcast 1980-09-22]" or "DTX[Published 1980-11]".
Unusual results can be described in an extended result field:
"REX[The players went for a nap, and it was decided that both lost]".
<p>
<font size="-2">
There have been various other proposals to represent such information.
One such proposal suggests to separate the free text part from the
formalized part by a colon, as in DT[1934:Spring],
DT[1845-03-03,04:Played nonstop through the night],
DT[1844-04-15:Tenpo 15-II-28], DT[:Early Qing era].
Another proposal suggests to use further elements of the
PropValue sequence. No actual usage of such proposals is known.
<!-- (But see BP below.) -->
</font>

</p><h2><a name="units">Units</a></h2>
Time properties require a unit of time. One uses 's', 'm', 'h'
for seconds, minutes and hours. If no unit is given, the time
is taken to be in seconds.

<h2><a name="proplist">List of properties</a></h2>
Here we give details for the above-mentioned properties,
in alphabetical order.
<p>
According to the grammar, a <i>Property</i> consists of an identifier
(<i>PropIdent</i>) followed by one or more values (<i>PropValue</i>s).

</p><h3><a name="valuetypes">Value types</a></h3>
The syntax for the <i>PropValue</i>s is one of

<dd>
DT[value] has as value an ISO standard date, when available.
For example DT[1946-07-31].
When less information is available, one can omit day, as in DT[1946-07],
and month, as in DT[1946]. When more information is available, one can
add the starting time, as in DT[2000-01-01 00:53].
For games played over several days, the dates can be given separated
by commas, or by .. or ~ to denote an interval. Such a sequence of dates
can be condensed, as in DT[1946-07-31,08-15,16,17].
A Japanese era date is given via the JD property.

In many cases this is only a reserved number. No actual use
is being made of SGF game records in most of these playing communities.
However, <a href="http://www.gnubg.com/documentation/doku.php?id=working_with_matches">GNU backgammon</a> uses SGF.
There is some use for LOA (Lines of Action).

<dt>KM</dt>
<dd>
KM[value] has as value a decimal number, positive or negative.
For example, KM[7.5]. One might wish to recognize values
postfixed by "å­", for example KM[3.75å­] or KM[3å3/4å­],
for games under Chinese rules.
This "å­" postfix can be regarded as a unit of 2 points.
Similarly, "ç®" represents a unit of 1 point, and can be ignored.
</dd>

<dt>OH</dt>
<dd>("Old Handicap". Property introduced by GoGoD.) Examples:
<!-- see http://senseis.xmp.net/?Uchikomi -->
<!-- see http://senseis.xmp.net/?MatchHandicapSystem -->
<table class="sm">
<tbody><tr><th>name</th> <th>notation</th> <th>comments</th></tr>
<tr><td>tagai-sen</td> <td>OH[B-W]</td> <td>Equal rank players, alternate in taking black</td></tr>
<tr><td>sen-ai-sen</td> <td>OH[B-W-B]</td> <td>Weaker player gets black two out of three games</td></tr>

</tbody></table>
It is not necessary to indicate the weaker player (since he takes black),
except in the case of sen-ai-sen, where OH[(B)-W-B] and OH[B-(W)-B] denote
a game with the weaker player taking black respectively white.
<!-- the former would be åäºåï¼å -->
Often, the hyphens are omitted.
</dd>

<dt>PB, PW</dt>
<dd>In Pair Go two black players and two white players play in turn.
In Relay Go, several black players and several white players play in turn.
In such a case, the PB and PW values list the players with player names
separated by "&amp;". Similarly, the BR and WR values list player ranks
separated by "&amp;". For example,
<tt>PB[Segoe Kensaku &amp; Makino Jozan &amp; Fujisawa Kuranosuke] BR[8d &amp; 3d &amp; 7d]
PW[Go Seigen &amp; Shinohara Masami &amp; Hayashi Yutaro] WR[8d &amp; 6d &amp; 7d]</tt>.
An alternative markup style includes the ranks with PB, PW separated from
the player name by a comma, and omits the BR and WR properties.
For example,
<tt>PB[Segoe Kensaku, 8d &amp; Makino Jozan, 3d &amp; Fujisawa Kuranosuke, 7d]
PW[Go Seigen, 8d &amp; Shinohara Masami, 6d &amp; Hayashi Yutaro, 7d]</tt>.
</dd>

<dt><a name="RE">RE</a></dt>
<dd>
RE[value] has as value "B+" or "W+" when Black or White won,
possibly followed by a number if they won by that number of points,
or followed by "R", "T", or "F" when the game ended by
resign, time exceeded, or forfeit.
The value for jigo is "Jigo". If the rules say that jigo counts as a win
for Black or for White, the value is "B+0" or "W+0".
The value may also be "Void" (with explanation, such as "triple ko",
elsewhere). Or "Unfinished". Or "Playing", in case this is a live game,
still being played. Or "?", if the result is unknown.
</dd>

<dt>RU</dt>
<dd>
RU[value] has as value the string "Japanese" or "Chinese" or "Ing"
in case these rules are used. A year or other description can be added
when important. Other values may occur.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>

</p><h2><a name="historical">Historical remarks</a></h2>
<h3><a name="identifiers">Property identifiers</a></h3>
Modern property names are upper case only.
In ancient game records one meets "Black[jj]" instead of "B[jj]",
and "REsult[B+3]" instead of "RE[B+3]",
and "SiZe[19]" instead of "SZ[19]", and "CoPyright[...]" instead of "CP[...]".
Software handling SGF must be able to accept lower case
letters in property names (and ignore them).
Similarly, one meets "RE[B+Resign]", "RE[B+Time]", "RE[B+Forfeit]"
instead of "RE[B+R]", "RE[B+T]", "RE[B+F]".
<p>
Usually, the first symbol of a property identifier is upper case,
but one meets "GaMe[1]goWriteVersion[1.4e]".
</p><p>
There have been times that a property name had at most two
upper case letters. Modern software accepts property names
of arbitrary length. Property names like KGSDE, KGSSB, KGSSW and
MULTIGOGM are common.

</p><h3><a name="escapes">Escapes</a></h3>
The above grammar only gives special status to the "]" symbol,
and no other symbols need escaping than this, and a "\" that is
not meant to be an escape. Earlier grammars also made the colon ":" special,
and one meets escaped colons, and escaped multibyte characters of which the
first byte is '\' or ']' or ':'. Such escapes can be ignored.
<!--
One also meets escapes inside a multibyte character of which a later byte
is '\' or ']' or ':'. Such escapes should be deleted if one manages to
recognize them.
-->

<h3><a name="indivprops">Individual properties</a></h3>
<dl>
<dt>AP</dt> <dd>In the FF[4] standard this has syntax
"<i>simpletext</i> ':' <i>simpletext</i>", where the idea is that
the colon separates program name and version. In practice one sees
e.g. <tt>GoGoD95</tt> and <tt>Free Climber 0 . 8 . 11 . 61</tt>
without colon.</dd>
<dt>B, W</dt> <dd>Since <tt>ss</tt> is the lower right hand corner
of a 19x19 board, <tt>tt</tt> was used to denote a pass.
But larger boards are sometimes used, and a pass should now be
written <tt>B[]</tt> or <tt>W[]</tt>.</dd>
<dt>CA</dt> <dd>In FF[4] the default character set was ISO-8859-1
aka Latin-1. Today this is unreasonable, and UTF-8 is the new default.
On the one hand because there is no reason to expect Western Europe
to be the main producer of SGF files. On the other hand, because
ASCII and UTF-8 can be recognized with high confidence, while
ISO-8859-1 cannot easily be recognized.</dd>
<dt>CR</dt> <dd>It is common for display programs to indicate the
last move in some way, e.g. with a circle. Sometimes a game record
is redundantly marked up with lots of CR[]s, since each move was the last one
when it was played. Of course such last-move circles need not be
indicated in the game record.</dd>
<dt>PL</dt> <dd>
The color of the player to move is indicated by B or W, sometimes
Black or White. In older files one also sees PL[1] and PL[2]
instead of PL[B] and PL[W]. (This is according to the
<a href="http://www.red-bean.com/sgf/ff1_3/ff3.html#SGF4List">alphabetical
list</a> in the FF[3] standard.)
</dd>
<dt>RE</dt> <dd>In the FF[4] standard the result Jigo is represented
as RE[0]. In practice one finds collections where the result is
missing for all games with Jigo result. Writing <tt>RE[Jigo]</tt>
is more robust.</dd>
<dt>TM</dt> <dd>In the FF[4] standard the parameter is a real.
In practice this is inconvenient, and one encounters <tt>TM[5400]</tt>
and <tt>TM[300]</tt> where <tt>TM[15h]</tt> and <tt>TM[5h]</tt> was meant.
Using units leads to fewer errors.</dd>
</dl>

<h3><a name="obsolete">Obsolete properties</a></h3>
In the FF[4] and earlier standards several properties are described
that are omitted here. Nothing is wrong with properties outside the
present text, except that they are not standardized here, and their
function will depend on the software used.
<p>
Examples are AR (Arrow), BM (Bad move), BS (Black Species),
CH (Check mark), DD (Dim points), DG (Diagram),
DI (Difficulty of a problem), DM (even position),
DO (Doubtful move), EL (Eval. comp move), EX (Expected move),
FG (Figure), GB (Good for Black), GW (Good for White), HO (Hotspot),
KO (illegal move), ID (Game identifier),
IL (Illegal move), IT (Interesting move),
L (Letter), LN (Line),
LT (Loss on Time is enforced), M (Mark),
OM (Moves per overtime), ON (Opening Name), OP(Overtime period),
OV (Operator overhead), PM (Print move mode), RG (Region),
SC (Secure stones), SE (Self test),
SI (positions marked with a Sigma), ST (Style),
TC (Territory Count), TE (Tesuji), UC (Unclear position),
V (Value), WS (White Species).

<!--
<h3>Variations</h3>
There have been other conventions about the way to store variations,
and it is possible to criticize the version standardized here.
-->

</p><h2><a name="remarks">General remarks</a></h2>

<h3><a name="coords">Coordinates</a></h3>
The default SGF coordinates have origin upper-left and rows and columns
labeled a..s (on a 19x19 board). The standard coordinates used in the
West have origin bottom-left, with rows numbered 1..19, and columns A..T
where the I is skipped. It is easy to extend software to understand
both systems of coordinates.

<h3><a name="timeprops">Time properties</a></h3>
At the end of the game, one wishes to write how much time the game
took. Nowadays that often takes the form of a comment:
<tt>C[Time used: B: 9h59m, W: 4h58m]</tt>.
Sometimes TM is misused here. One might consider adding a property
TU ("Time used").
<p>
Overtime has many forms. 
Canadian byo-yomi gives each player an indefinite number of
byo-yomi periods in each of which a fixed number of moves
has to be played. For Canadian byo-yomi, the OT description
should mention (i) that Canadian byo-yomi is used,
(ii) the length of each period, (iii) the number of moves/period.
For example: <tt>OT[30 moves / 10m]</tt>.
After each move one can give OB and BL or OW and WL to indicate
the number of moves still to make, and the time available for that.
After the last move in a period, with <i>t</i> seconds left,
it is better to give <tt>OB[0]BL[</tt><i>t</i><tt>]</tt> than to give
say <tt>OB[30]BL[600]</tt> (in case of 30 moves in a 10-minute period),
since the latter does not provide new information, and the former
enables one to see how much time was spent on this move.
</p><p>
Japanese byo-yomi gives each player a fixed number of byo-yomi periods
of fixed length, for example 10 periods of 1 minute each. Time counting
starts anew for each new move. Over the entire game each player can use
the given number of full byo-yomi periods, and an arbitrary number of
partial periods. For Japanese byo-yomi, the OT description should mention
(i) that Japanese byo-yomi is used,
(ii) the number of periods, (iii) the length of each period.
For example: <tt>OT[10x1m]</tt>. Equivalently, <tt>LC[10] LT[60]</tt>
(or <tt>TC[10] TT[60]</tt>).
After each move one might write the number of remaining periods,
say again using properties OB and OW.
</p><p>
In a match under the Ing rules, players can buy additional time
a few times, and pay with points (as if komi was increased or decreased).
For example, a player may be able to buy an additional 20m time period
at most three times, and lose when the last period is exhausted.
The price of a period is 2 points. The default length of a period is 1/6th
of the length of the main time, as given by TM.
Of interest is the number of time periods each player bought (and when),
and their length when not default. The default komi is 8 (with jigo a win
for Black). A way to represent the points paid might be to add them to /
subtract them from the komi, so that KM[14] indicates that Black bought
three additional periods. Details can be given in a Game Comment.

</p><h3><a name="commentprops">Comment properties</a></h3>
One needs at least three different types of comment.
Comments on the moves are given with C.
Comments on the game are given with GC.
Comments on the SGF file are needed, but no standard label is in common use.

<h3><a name="privateprops">Private properties</a></h3>
In order to avoid future conficts, one can use a prefix for private
properties. For example, KGS uses or used a few properties with KGS- prefix
describing the counting process.
<p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><th>prop</th> <th>meaning</th> <th>arg syntax</th> <th>description</th></tr>
<tr><td>KGSDE</td> <td>Dead</td> <td><i>pointlist</i></td> <td>List of stones regarded dead</td></tr>
<tr><td>KGSSB</td> <td>Score Black</td> <td><i>real</i></td> <td>Total number of points for Black</td></tr>
<tr><td>KGSSW</td> <td>Score White</td> <td><i>real</i></td> <td>Total number of points for White</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</p><p>
This shows the use of a private prefix to avoid name clashes.
Should it become desirable to standardize these properties,
they should probably be called DE, SB and SW.
</p><p>
Multigo uses MULTIGOGM and MULTIGOBM (bookmark).
</p><p>
GoGoD PBase uses or used the rootnode property KK
(label or key, used in problem collections).
<!-- The syntax seems to be {"^" key}, starting with caret,
and with carets as separators. -->
</p><p>
The Dragon Go Server uses or used a private property XM to indicate the number
of the next move, as in XM[245], used as a rootnode property.
Elsewhere XM[] is used to indicate the last move of the actual game,
in the NodeSequence of that last move, often in a situation with variations.
<!-- It looks like the placement of each handicap stone counts
as a move here. -->
</p><p>
SmartGo uses or used a largish number of private properties:
</p><p>
<font size="-2">
TY (Moyo points), TZ (Unsettled points),
TC (Blocks that can be captured tactically),
TP (One of several blocks can be captured tactically),
TK (Ko points: Control of territory depends on winning a ko, for both sides),
KB (Ko points favorable for black: Black can play to control those points,
white can make a ko),
KW (Ko points favorable for white: White can play to control those points,
black can make a ko),
E (List of points where stones are captured, or empty list in the root),
EG (For Environmental Go: list of coupon values),
TU (The time used to solve a problem),
NN (The number of nodes examined to solve a problem),
NL (The number of evaluations or leaf nodes),
MD (The maximal depth reached during a search),
DE (Depth: the number of plies searched),
PD (Partial Depth: the number of top level moves at deepest search),
MO (The move motive),
MM (All move motives),
PN (Proof number),
DN (Disproof number),
QE, QB, QW (in search patterns: Not Empty, Not Black, Not White).
</font>
</p><p>

</p><h3><a name="SGF2">SGF2 properties</a></h3>
There is an SGF dialect with files starting out "(" instead of "(;",
and with property names GM, EV, KM, DT replaced by GK, TE, KO, RD.
Sometimes this dialect is attributed to Nihon Ki-in.
One also sees HD for the combination HA plus AB.
<p>

</p><h3><a name="compression">Compressed sequences</a></h3>
The typical SGF file has lots of redundancy: a long string
B[xx]W[yy]B[zz]... of moves with alternating colors, where
the first color is clear from the context.
SmartGo uses or has used the compressed version S[xxyyzz...].

This starts out with lots of well-known properties, and the first one
not documented yet is ST.
</p><p>
<font size="-2">(This ST is a backwards-compatibility hack.
It is a metaproperty intended to tell the current display program
which display program was used by the author of the comments.
Some display programs would automatically assign labels a, b, c, ...
to siblings of the current node. Some would assign such labels to
children of the current node. The current user interface might wish
to know what style was used originally and mimic the behavior of the
old display program, so that letters used in comments are understandable.
This metaproperty also stores another bit of information, namely whether
upon display there should be automatic board markup for variations.
Of the above occurrences of ST, 96% are <tt>ST[2]</tt>: no markup.)
</font>
</p><p>
TI is "Tournament Index", an integer numbering tournaments.<!--gokifu-->
Of course B and W in the root node are mistakes.
The properties TE, KO, RD, GK are aliases for EV, KM, DT, GM in SGF2 style.
MULTIGOGM (with value 0 or 1) is probably left by the Go editor MultiGo.
TC can be Territory Count or Tail Comment.
</p><p>
<font size="-2">
A non-commented game record often has metainformation only in rootnode
and final node. Since comments in the final node are a bit fragile
(comments are often stripped away outside the rootnode), some sites use
TC[<i>text</i>] in the root node, and C[<i>text</i>] on the final node
(with the same text).
</font>
</p><p>
TL and LKM and PTM and PDT are aliases for TM and KM and TM and DT.
The property ZZ gives an explanation (in Chinese) of the following property
label.
</p><p>
<font size="-2">
For example,
"ZZ[ç½æ¹å§å]PW[æ²³éä¸´]ZZ[ç½æ¹è±æ]WE[Kono Rin]ZZ[ç½æ¹æ®µä½]WR[ä¹æ®µ]"
says "ZZ[White player name]PW[æ²³éä¸´]ZZ[White player English name]WE[Kono Rin]ZZ[White player rank]WR[9p]".
<br>
An interesting reflexive metaproperty. This usage violates the rule that
each property label may occur at most once in a node. Property names
that occur in this context: SZ, RM, EV, GT, GB, GS, SK,
DT, DC, PC, PB, BE, BR, BK, PW, WE, WR, WK, KM, SO, US,
RE, RC, NT, OA, OB, ON, OC, OT, LC.
</font>
</p><p>
In goproblems one sees GE (problem type, e.g. "joseki", "life and death",
"tesuji", "endgame") and DI ("Difficulty", with values e.g. <tt>7k</tt>,
<tt>1d</tt>) and CO and DP (two integers with unknown meaning).
Of course one also needs to describe what variations are correct and wrong,
but usually that is done with a formalized comment.
</p><p>
TEV looks like a mistake or a year, 
OM gives the total number of moves, or the number of moves per Canadian
byoyomi period, KI ("Integer Komi") gives twice the komi, SY ("System")
gives the Go Editor version (e.g. "Cgoban 1.9.2", "Written by GoBase-0.0.9",
"Converted by sgf2misc-2.7.2").
</p><p>
BP and WP form a solution to what to do in the case of multiple players.
One writes BP[player1][player2][player3].
A different solution uses PI ("People Involved") and labels:
PI[B1 : Takahara Shuuji : 3p][W1 : Hasegawa Sunao : 9p].
</p><p>
<font size="-2">There is an
<a href="http://www.red-bean.com/sgf/ff5/new.htm">FF[5]</a> proposal.
Of the files investigated, 392 claimed FF[5].
(Rough distribution: no FF: 880000, FF[4]: 606000, FF[3]: 187000,
FF[1]: 4200, FF[5]: 392, FF[03]:4.)
These were roughly the same files that used AX (a small integer<!--0,1,2-->
with unknown meaning), PI (as above) and OT with a similar labeled style,
e.g. <tt>OT[TM:A:10800][TG:1][OP:A:60][OM:A:1][NO:-1]</tt>.
</font>
</p><p>
The Aya program uses T for "time used for the present move".
(It measures in seconds, with is not optimal, since there are frequent 0's.
Giving one decimal when the number of seconds is less than 10, say,
is probably better.)
However, in most of the files investigated T had values like <tt>8h</tt>,
with T an alias for TM, or values like <tt>Region:Korea</tt>.

<a href="http://gowrite.net/">GoWrite</a> is an SGF editor,

The top of the table is as expected: lots of moves B, W, a few more
Black moves than White. On average 102.3 Black moves per game and
101.9 White moves per game, for an average game length of 204 moves.
</p><p>
Comments C, markup with LB, N, CR, TR, MN, MA, SQ, M,
time left and byo-yomi periods left BL, WL, OB, OW.
</p><p>
The AB and AW were mostly mistakes (these should have been B, W
or should have been in the rootnode). Some of the AB, AW, AE come
from an old style of handling variations, where first the actual move
is given, and then variations are noted as children of that node
(instead of siblings), by undoing the actual move with AE,
and adding the variation move with AB or AW.
(Such a node ;AB[xy]AE[zw] shifts the node numbering by 1, and is
undesirable for many other reasons as well. Many viewers do not support it.)
</p><p>
RN and PT belong to a certain dialect of SGF2 and are found at the start
of a variation.
ID is used by some to number the moves. L gives a labeling letter.
TW and TB are the territories given at the end of the game.
SI is a FF[3] property that gives a position marked with a sigma.
I do not know what the nonroot TL is. One sees some moves marked with
<tt>TL[0,0]BL[0]</tt>.
</p><p>
Judgments BM ("Bad Move"), GB ("Good for Black"), GW ("Good for White"),
IT ("Interesting move"), EX ("Expected move"), DO ("Doubtful move")
are not seen very often (in this sample of SGF files).
</p><p>
Property E gives (in its own node) the stones captured by the
preceding move. E.g. <tt>;B[io];E[ip]</tt> and <tt>;W[dj];E[dk][ek]</tt>.
(It can be viewed as a command to empty these positions.)
Such a property is useful only for very weak viewers, that cannot
compute chains and liberties themselves. But if used they should have
been in the same node as the capturing move.
</p><p>
FG ("Figure"), V ("Value"). I do not know what the nonroot BS, WS are,
probably mistakes.
